ABSTRACT
Advertising movies with posters is an incredibly significant part of the film industry's marketing strategy, which intends to increase viewership and profits. With a good movie poster, a film's theme and genre can be conveyed to a wider audience, making the movie appear intriguing and appealing. In this project, specifically, we want to find out if a model could be trained to detect the movie genre by learning the features of the poster. Our goal is to examine not only the visual aspects of the poster but also analyze the textual information, to see if it can reinforce the model.
